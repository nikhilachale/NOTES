**State management** refers to the practice of handling the state (or data) of an application in a predictable, organised, and maintainable way. In a React application, managing state becomes increasingly complex as the application grows, and multiple components need to share and update state.

  

**Types of State in React:**

  

1. **Local State**: Managed within a single component using useState or useReducer.

2. **Global State**: Data shared between multiple components, typically managed using Reactâ€™s Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries.

3. **Server State**: Data that comes from external servers (e.g., fetched data) and is synchronized with the UI. Libraries like React Query or SWR help with managing server state.

4. **URL State**: Data stored in the URL, like query parameters or path segments, that reflects the state of the application (e.g., pagination, filters).
