MIDDLEWARES
Middleware is a request handler that allows you to intercept and manipulate requests and responses before they reach route handlers. They are the functions that are invoked by the [Express.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js/) routing layer.

It is a flexible tool that helps add functionalities like logging, authentication, error handling, and more to Express applications.
